# Advent of Code (AoC)

> *"Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other."* — [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/about)

This repository contains my personal solutions for the puzzles across all years.
